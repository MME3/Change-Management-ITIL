There are different ways for doing that and here, in dependency to the Alfresco Hackathon 2019 10th May https://community.alfresco.com/docs/DOC-8142-global-virtual-hack-a-thon-spring-2019, shall be the location for having the material.

Change Management basic:

1. Step: Request for Change (Spin doctor)
2. Step: Complete and connect the RFC with other RFC´s (Change-Manager)
3. Step: Evaluating the RFC, Accept, Reject... (Evaluation Role)
4a. Step: If accepted -> construct a project and pass it to employee, closing the RFC, feedback to Spin doctor
